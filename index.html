    <p class="section-content">Buchla's instruments, such as the Music Easel (pictured abouve), use a different method of timbre generation from Moog synthesizers. Moog units use oscillators with basic function generator type waveshapes and rely heavily on filtering with 24 dB resonant low-pass filters, while Buchlas are geared toward complex oscillators using frequency modulation, amplitude modulation, and dynamic waveshaping to produce other forms of timbre modulation. Many of Don Buchla's designs, including the Low-Pass Gates (later called Dynamic Managers) contain vactrols, photoresistive opto-isolator employed as voltage-controlled potentiometers, which can be used for a more "natural", typical Buchla sound.<p>

    <p class="section-content">The new incarnation of the 1973 Buchla Music Easel is a portable, performance-oriented instrument as close as possible to the original. We have used the same circuits, mechanical design and graphic theme that made the original an ergonomic dream to grab hold of and create organic electronic music from the soul. The Music Easel is comprised of 2 units: a 218e Touch Keyboard Controller and a 208e Stored Program Sound Source, both housed in a rugged carrying case. Together these modules allow both real-time control from the keyboard pads, knobs, sliders, switches and patch points. Additionally the Music Easel supports the included original Program Cards (user-defined presets using resistors, 1973-style!) as well as future interface cards with more modern patch storage/editing/control/interfacing.<p>

    <p class="section-content">The Music Easel contains many of the elements commonly used to generate and process sound: a keyboard, sequencer, pulser, preamplifier, envelope detector and balanced modulator; oscillators, gates, envelope generators and filters; facilities for mixing, monitoring and reverberating. Many of these elements possess an unusual degree of sophistication. The keyboard is solid state, with touch sensitive, chromatically organized keys, accurate and reproducible pressure output, tactile feedback, octave shifting, and voltage controlled portamento. A complex oscillator, developed through computer aided simulation studies, is a rich source of complex audio spectra. featuring voltage control of pitch, timbre and waveform, this oscillator provides the Music Easel with a timbral range unapproached by other musical instruments.<p>   
    <p class="section-content">With its extended timbral resources, unusual expressive capability, and its facility for storage and recall of instrument definitions, the Music Easel opens new horizons to the composer and performer. To appreciate its potential as a new musical instrument the Music Easel must be seen, heard and played.</p>
